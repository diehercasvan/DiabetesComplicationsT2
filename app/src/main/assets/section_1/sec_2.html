			<p>
				<b>a. Diabetic neuropathy</b>
				<br>
				The main form of presentation of diabetic neuropathy is Distal Symmetric Polyneuropathy.<sup>8</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				The main findings in peripheral nerves of diabetic patients include distal sensory fibers degeneration, axonal loss, and endoneurial microangiopathy.<sup>6</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				Anatomically, peripheral nerves are susceptible to hypoxia because they are covered by perineurium, and because only a few transperineurial arterioles penetrate endoneurium.<sup>6</sup> The vascular supply of peripheral nerves is low, lacks self-regulation, and blood flow may be involved due to small blood vessels alterations (Figure 2).<sup>6</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				Diabetes duration and increased glycated hemoglobin levels have been associated with diabetic neuropathy.<sup>6</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				Sustained hyperglycemia produces neuropathy through activation of several metabolic routes that produces oxidative stress.<sup>6,9</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				In small blood vessels, hyperglycemia produces basement membrane reduplication, vascular occlusion, alterations in the barrier between nerve fibers and endoneurium and perineurium blood vessels.<sup>9</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				Peripheral neuropathy affects long and short fibers; Figure 3 shows the classification of nerve fibers by diameter, presence of myelin and signals transmitted (Figure 3).<sup>6</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Hyperglycemia leads to:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Activation of polyol pathway (increased sorbitol, fructose and decreased myo-inositol)<sup>6</sup></li>
					<li>Increase in advanced glycation end products (AGEs)<sup>6,9</sup></li>
					<li>Activation of protein kinase C (PKC)<sup>6,9</sup></li>
					<li>Increased oxidative stress<sup>6,9</sup></li>
					<li>Increased proinflammatory states<sup>6</sup></li>
					<li>Alteration of trophic and cellular factors (neurotrophins)<sup>6</sup></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Hyperglycemia causes a downstream signaling that leads to polyol pathway hyperactivity, reactions between advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and receptors (RAGEs), and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS).<sup>6</sup> All of them affect small endoneurial blood vessels and neural tissue through activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and protein kinase C (PKC), increase in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), as well as activation of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κβ), leading to functional and structural changes of neuropathy.<sup>5</sup> Metabolic alterations are accompanied by proinflammatory changes, cytokines release, neurotrophins suppression, and macrophage migration into the neural tissue that promotes neuropathy.<sup>5</sup> Recently, it has been proposed that certain bone marrow cellular factors as well as nerve perfusion/reperfusion may accelerate nervous tissue damage (Figure 4).<sup>6</sup>
					<h3>b. Neuropathic pain</h3>
					Currently, painful sensation is known to have several stages (Figure 5):
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Transduction:</b> Generation of an action potential by receptor stimulation by a noxa (nociceptor).<sup>10</sup></li>
					<li><b>Transmission:</b> Action potential travels to first and second neurons.<sup>10</sup></li>
					<li><b>Modulation:</b> Process occurring in spinal cord and brain; Includes painful stimulus spread, inhibition and attenuation.<sup>10</sup></li>
					<li><b>Perception:</b> Occurs in upper structures of the central nervous system which determine behavior, discrimination and pain response quality (motor, affective and cognitive).<sup>10</sup></li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Neuropathic pain results from dysfunction in any stage of pain impulse transmission.<sup>11</sup> Both peripheral and central sensitization (nerve endings, dorsal root ganglia, spinal dorsal horn, and somatosensory cortex) have been observed.11 In addition, neuron spontaneous activity occurs due to increased expression of nerve growth factors, cytokines and receptors.<sup>11,12</sup>
