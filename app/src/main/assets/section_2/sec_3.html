				<b>
				In over 90% of cases of acute MI with ST elevation, the underlying cause is nonocclusive atherosclerotic plaque erosion or rupture in a major coronary artery, which leads to complete blockage through thrombus formation.<sup>12</sup>
				</b>
				In patients with DM, atherosclerosis is widespread and diffuse, occurs earlier, and distally.<sup>7</sup>
				<br>
				At the time of diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), several coronary vessels have already been affected.<sup>7</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>4.1. Macrovascular disease pathogenesis in diabetes</b>
				<br>
				Atherosclerosis (Figure 4) begins with monocyte adhesion to vascular wall, especially to endothelial cells. Monocytes then migrate to subendothelial space where differentiate into macrophages. Macrophages are able to capture lipids and therefore turn into foam cells, which accumulate in the vessel wall. The initial atherosclerotic lesion is fatty streak. As the injury progresses, infiltration of smooth muscle cells and formation of necrotic core are evidenced in the plaque.<sup>13</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				Vulnerable plaque has a large lipid core. The fibrous layer is thin, the macrophage density is high (with increase of metalloproteinases), there are neovascularization and high concentrations of tissue factor. Subsequent events lead to the expansion of the plaque, destabilization, rupture or erosion, and thrombogenesis.<sup>12</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>
				The following factors have been postulated in the genesis of coronary disease in diabetes:
				</b>
				<ul>
				<li><b>Hyperglycemia:</b> in previous (UK Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS], Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [DCCT]) and recent (ADVANCE and ACCORD) clinical studies, a significant effect of glycemic control on cardiovascular disease has not been proven.<sup>13</sup></li>
				<li>
					<b>Glucotoxicity</b> hyperglycemia has a direct toxic effect on vascular endothelial cells.<sup>13</sup> Glucotoxicity is associated with formation of Advanced Glycosylation End (AGE) products, glycation of DNA, increased damage associated with oxidative stress, increased production of protein kinase C beta (PKC β) and mitochondrial stress.<sup>13</sup></li>
				<li>
					<b>Metabolic Memory:</b> postulates that episodes of poor glycemic control during the early stages of the disease may precipitate or accelerate the development of late complications of diabetes.<sup>13</sup> Hyperglycemia causes sustained atherogenic effects during periods of normoglycemia.<sup>13</sup></li>
				<li>
					<b>Insulin resistance:</b> is known as an independent risk factor for atherogenesis.<sup>13</sup> Insulinresistance is associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia (high VLDL cholesterol, low HDL and small dense LDL).<sup>13</sup></li>
				<li>
					<b>AGE formation:</b> glycation end products cause endothelial function alteration and influence the development of macrovascular disease.<sup>13</sup> AGE modify collagen of the vascular wall, decreasing its adaptability and increasing its rigidity.<sup>13</sup> Activation of receptor for AGE (RAGE) leads to activation of nuclear factor kappa beta (NFκβ,) transcription which has a proinflammatory action.<sup>13</sup> Other pathways with inflammatory actions that are activated by RAGE include: NADPH oxidase, the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), p21ras protein (p21ras), the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and protein kinase C (PKC).<sup>13</sup> AGE accumulation can activate some components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).<sup>13</sup></li>
				<li>
					<b>Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS):</b> RAAS activation in patients with diabetes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction (ED).<sup>13</sup> ED is the result of an imbalance between the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator action on vascular tone, due to the decreased activity of nitric oxide and increased activity of angiotensinogen II (ATII) and endothelin (ET).<sup>13</sup> RAAS activation leads to a prothrombotic status (thrombosis, hypercoagulability, platelet activation and decreased fibrinolysis), inflammatory status (inflammation, production of cytokines, chemokines and increased cell adhesion molecules) and vasoconstriction (Figure 5).<sup>13</sup></li>
				<li>
					<b>Urotensin and endothelin:</b> in patients with diabetes, it has been shown an activation of urotensin II and endothelin system which leads to inflammation, remodeling, decreased nitric oxide, vasoconstriction, in addition to increased production of angiotensin II, aldosterone and norepinephrine (Figure 6).<sup>13</sup></li>
