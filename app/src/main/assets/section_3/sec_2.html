			<p>
				<b>
				According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), in 2013, 8.3% of adults worldwide, about 382 million people, had diabetes. Without appropriate interventions, this number will be increased to over 592 million people in 2035, which represents an increase of 55%.7 It is estimated that every 10 minutes, about 3 new cases of diabetes are diagnosed.<sup>7</sup>
				</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				The National Health and Nutrition Survey 2006 (known in Spanish as ENSANUT) estimated that the overall prevalence of diabetes in Mexico was 14% (7,34% of patients had previously diagnosed diabetes; and 7,07% were diagnosed during the survey). According to that data, in 2006 in Mexico, there were 7,3 million people with diabetes.<sup>8</sup> Of patients with previously diagnosed disease, 56,2% had a very poor control of their disease; 38.4%, poor control; and only 5.3% had good control of diabetes.<sup>8</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>
				In Mexico, between 1993 (ENEC) and 2006 (ENSANUT), a growing trend in the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors was shown:<sup>9</sup>
				</b>
				<ul>
					<li><span style="margin-right:26px;"><b>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:</b></span><span>6.7% → 14.4% </span></li>
					<li><span style="margin-right:55px;"><b>Metabolic syndrome:</b></span><span>26.6% → 36.8%</span></li>
					<li><span style="margin-right:105px;"><b>Hypertension:</b></span><span>23.8% → 30.7%</span></li>
					<li><span style="margin-right:42px;"><b>Hypercholesterolemia:</b></span><span> 27% → 43.6% </span></li>
					<li><span style="margin-right:50px;"><b>High LDL Cholesterol:</b></span><span>31.6% → 46% </span></li>
					<li><span style="margin-right:51px;"><b>Low HDL Cholesterol:</b></span><span>60.5% → 63% </span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					According to the Pan American Health Organization, in 2013, stroke (7,03%) was the second cause of mortality in the Americas (Figure 2).<sup>10</sup>
					<br>
					<br>
					In Mexico, according to The National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), in 2013, the first three causes of overall mortality were: ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus and malignancies (Figure 3).<sup>11</sup>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Stroke and diabetes</b>
					<br>
					Cardiovascular diseases (stroke, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease) are the leading causes of mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).<sup>12</sup>
					<br>
					Eighty percent of deaths among diabetic patients are due to macrovascular manifestations of the disease.<sup>12</sup>
					<br> 
					Risk of stroke of thromboembolic origin is increased in patients with DM, even after adjusting by other associated risk factors.<sup>12</sup> 
					<br>
					Risk of hemorrhagic stroke does not seem to be increased in patients with DM.
					<br>
					Mortality in patients with DM is higher after a cerebral infarction.<sup>12</sup> 
					<br>
					In people with DM and stroke, the long-term prognosis is worse, and there is a higher frequency of sequels, an increased risk of recurrence, and increased mortality within the first six months after the event.<sup>12</sup>
