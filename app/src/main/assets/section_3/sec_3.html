			<p>
				<b>
				There are three types of risk factors for stroke: 
				</b>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Non-modifiable<sup>13</sup></li>
					<li>Modifiable<sup>13</sup></li>
					<li>New risk factors<sup>13</sup></li>
				</ol>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Non-modifiable risk factors:</b><br>
					</li>
					<b>Age: </b>
					Stroke is more common in patients over 60 years (risk increases with each decade of life and the presence of other risk factors).<sup>13</sup>
					<br>
					<b>Sex: </b>
					Women have an estrogen-protective effect until menopause.<sup>13</sup> In general terms, stroke is more common in men than in women.<sup>14</sup> Mortality rates are higher among patients with history of low weight at birth.<sup>14</sup>
					<br>
					<b>Race: </b>
					African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans have higher rates of stroke and mortality.<sup>14</sup>
					 <br>
					 <b>Genetic factors: </b>
					 Family history of stroke increases risk in about 30%.<sup>14</sup> Children of stroke patients have a 1.5 higher risk of having stroke.<sup>13</sup> The presence of the phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4D) and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenaseactivating protein (ALOX5AP) genes increases the risk for stroke.<sup>13</sup> 
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Modifiable risk factors:</b>
					</li>
					<b>Hypertension:</b> HTN is a risk factor for both cerebral infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage; the association between hypertension and stroke is strong, continuous, gradual, consistent, independent, predictive and etiologically significant.<sup>14</sup> In the ICDANA study, a decrease of 6.5 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure was associated with a decrease between 30% and 40% for the risk of a first stroke.<sup>13</sup> The use of certain angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) reduces the risk of stroke between 25% and 43%.<sup>13</sup> 
					<br>
					<b>Smoking:</b> Smoking is a strong risk factor for stroke.<sup>14</sup> Smoking increases twice the risk for ischemic stroke.<sup>14</sup>
					<br>
					<b>Diabetes mellitus:</b> the incidence of stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is 2 to 4 times higher than in the rest of the population.<sup>15</sup> Stroke risk is greater in the group of 40-60 years, especially in women (RR 2.2 for women compared with 1.8 for men).<sup>15</sup> In patients with diabetes, the most common types of stroke are atherothrombotic and lacunar.<sup>15</sup> Several epidemiological studies have shown that the relationship between DM2 and hemorrhagic stroke is unclear.<sup>15</sup><br> The profiles of stroke among patients and the general population are different (Table 2).<sup>15</sup> DM and hypertension are the most important factors associated with greater extension of subcortical stroke, with multiple lacunar infarcts being the most frequent radiological pattern.<sup>15</sup>
					<br>
					<b>Atrial fibrillation:</b> AF is the most common supraventricular arrhythmia in clinical practice. AF patients have an incidence of ischemic stroke of 5% per year, which corresponds to an incidence between 2 and 7 times greater than in people without AF.<sup>16</sup> Twenty percent of patients with AF also have DM.<sup>17</sup>
					<br>
					<b>Dyslipidemia:</b> currently available information about relationship between stroke and dyslipidemia indicates that:
					<ul>
						<li>Some epidemiological studies have found a relationship between high cholesterol levels and the risk of ischemic stroke.<sup>14</sup></li>
						<li>Some studies have found an increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke with lower cholesterol levels.<sup>14</sup></li>
						<li>Some epidemiological studies have found an inverse relationship between HDL cholesterol levels and stroke.<sup>14</sup></li>
						<li>Studies to demonstrate the relationship between triglycerides and stroke are inconsistent.<sup>14</sup></li>
					</ul>
					<b>Coronary heart disease:</b> In patients with coronary heart disease, the risk of stroke is twice the risk of the general population.<sup>13</sup>
					<br>
					<b>Prior stroke:</b> compared with patients with acute myocardial infarction, stroke patients 	are 3 to 4 times at higher risk of a second stroke within the first two years.<sup>13</sup> Ten percent	of patients with TIA will develop a stroke within the first three months; 50% within the first two days.<sup>13</sup>
					<br>
					<b>Other heart conditions:</b> people with dilated cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease 	(mitral valve prolapse, endocarditis and prosthetic valves), congenital heart defects 	(patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defects) have an increased risk of stroke.<sup>13</sup> Twenty	percent of all ischemic strokes are cardioembolic.<sup>13</sup>
					<br>
					<b>Atherosclerotic carotid disease:</b> people with atherosclerotic stenotic carotid artery disease have an increased risk for stroke.<sup>14</sup>
					<br>
					<b>Dietary factors:</b> are important as they are associated with higher prevalence of hypertension. They may include: salt intake, low potassium intake, overweight and obesity, and high consumption of alcohol.<sup>14</sup>
					<br>
					<b>Sedentary lifestyle:</b> Physical inactivity is associated with an increased risk of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular disease and stroke.<sup>14</sup>
					<br>
					<b>Obesity:</b> In some studies, the total body fat was a strong predictor of stroke.<sup>14</sup>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Other less-documented risk factors for stroke include:</b> migraine, metabolic syndrome, alcohol consumption, drug abuse, sleep breathing disorders (snoring, obstructive sleep apnea).<sup>14</sup></li>
						<li><b>New risk factors include:</b> ehyperhomocysteinemia, increased lipoprotein(a), inflammation and infection (with elevated fibrinogen, serum amyloid, Lp-LPA 2 and interleukin-6), which have been associated with increased risk of stroke.<sup>14</sup></li>
