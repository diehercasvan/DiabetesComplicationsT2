				<b>
				The pathogenesis of renal damage in diabetic patients is not fully understood.<sup>1</sup> There are multiple mechanisms identified and some of them are clearly related.<sup>1</sup> Hyperglycemia is an important factor in the genesis of renal damage.<sup>1</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				Some theories to explain DN
				</b>
				<br>
				Several theories have been proposed to explain DN:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Metabolic:</b> There is a causal link between hyperglycemia and diabetic nephropathy.<sup>1</sup> This theory is supported by the changes observed in the glomerular basement membrane after at least two years of evolution of diabetes, the correlation between the development of DN and duration of the disease, the effect of glycemic control on hyperfiltration, glomerular hypertrophy and microalbuminuria, regression of glomerular lesions in patients undergoing pancreas transplant, the appearance of glomerular injury in healthy kidneys transplanted into patients with DM and regression of renal changes when transplanting diseased kidneys to healthy patients.<sup>1</sup>
						<br>
						Hyperglycemia leads to the activation of multiple pathways, including: nonenzymatic glycation with generation of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), activation of protein kinase C (PKC), sorbitol formation, activation of hexosamines pathway, and increased oxidative stress, leading to formation of cytokines and growth factors that damage kidney tissue.<sup>9,10</sup>
						</li>
						<li>
						<b>Genetic:</b> It has been proposed the existence of a genetic factor which determines further destruction and cell division in diabetic patients, causing damage regardless the metabolic disturbance.<sup>1</sup>
						</li>
						<li>
						<b>Hemodynamic:</b> suggests that hypertension, increased blood flow and capillary pressure influence the development of glomerular lesions in DN.<sup>1</sup>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Growth factors in DN</b>
					<br>
					Several studies have shown the involvement of various cytokines and growth factors in the origin of DN.<sup>9</sup> Growth factors include transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF).<sup>9</sup> Generation of these factors and cytokines is involved in the microscopic and molecular changes of the DN.<sup>9</sup>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Renin angiotensin system and DN</b>
			 		<br>
			 		Angiotensin II (ATII) is the major effector of renin-angiotensin system.<sup>9</sup> ATII has vasoconstrictor effects on the efferent glomerular arterioles increasing glomerular capillary pressure and plasma protein filtration, which contributes to proteinuria.<sup>9</sup> ATII promotes cell growth, inflammation and fibrosis in the glomerulus. These effects are mediated by the synthesis of interleukin-6, platelet activating factor (PAF), arachidonic acid derivatives, and growth factors such as TGF-β, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).<sup>9</sup>
			 		<br>
			 		<br>
			 		<b>Podocytes in DN</b>
			 		<br>
			 		DN patients have impaired glomerular filtration barrier (composed of the glomerular endothelium, glomerular basement membrane, and podocyte).<sup>11</sup> The podocyte is the visceral glomerular epithelial cell.<sup>11</sup> The alteration of the filtration barrier leads to proteinuria.<sup>11</sup> Podocytes are affected by hyperglycemia, glycation, generation of reactive oxygen species, ATII, TGF-β and mechanical stretching, which decreases nephrin production, and leads to podocyte apoptosis and loss of podocyte pedicels.<sup>11</sup>
