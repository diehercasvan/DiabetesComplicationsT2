			<h1 id="subtitulo">7. Foot examination in diabetic patients</h1>
			<p>
				In all patients with diabetes mellitus a <b>foot exam should be performed at least once a year,</b> in order to establish the risk of injury and the methods of prevention.<sup>16</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				The examination includes the assessment of peripheral diabetic neuropathy, vascular assessment, evaluation of orthopedic disorders, including impaired foot physical support.<sup>16</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>a. Evaluation of peripheral neuropathy</b>
				<br>
				The exploration of the sensitivity is performed with the patient in prone position, with feet resting on a pillow (except Achilles reflex).<sup>14</sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				The elements used for this exploration are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Temperature:</b> Two metals pencil or test tube (hot-cold).<sup>14</sup></li>
					<li><b>Pain:</b> disposable lancet or Neuropen.<sup>14</sup></li>
					<li> <b>Vibration:</b> 128 Hz tuning fork or biothesiometer.<sup>14</sup></li>
					<li> <b>Reflexes:</b> reflex hammer.<sup>14</sup></li>
					<li> <b>Pressure:</b> Semmes-Weinstein 5.01 monofilament (when force is applied, it exerts a pressure of 10 grams).<sup>14</sup></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Once the total score has been obtained, the degree of neuropathy is determined according to the following scale (Table 3).<sup>14</sup>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>
						The absence of sensitivity in 4 of the 10 sites examined has a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 83% for the loss of protective sensation of feet.<sup>14</sup>
					</b>
					<br>
					<br>
					Other tests to assess the symmetric distal neuropathy are electromyography and evoked potentials.<sup>14</sup>
				</p>
				<p>
					Ten sites should be explored on each foot:
					<ul>
						<li>fingertip of first, third and fifth toes<sup>14</sup></li>
						<li>Head of first, third and fifth metatarsal bones<sup>14</sup></li>
						<li>Inner and outer edges of the midfoot<sup>14</sup></li>
						<li>The heel and the dorsum of the foot<sup>14</sup></li>
					</ul>
					Archilles reflex should also be evaluated<sup>15</sup>
					<p>
						The registration is done according to the data shown in table 2.
					</p>	
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>b. Assessment of autonomic neuropathy</b>
					<br>
					The presence of venous dilation, increased skin temperature, dry-cracked skin, temperature difference between both feet, resting tachycardia, and orthostatic hypotension should be evaluated on physical examination.<sup>14</sup>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>c. Assessment of motor neuropathy</b>
					<br>
					On physical examination, it is recommended to identify the presence or absence of: interosseous and lumbricals atrophy, hammer toes, claw toes, drop of the metatarsal heads, signs of increased support force, plantar hyperkeratosis.<sup>14</sup>
					<br>
					<br>
					Gait in feet and heels should be evaluated.<sup>14</sup> Muscle strength against gravity and resistance should be evaluated in all segments.<sup>14</sup>
					<br>
					<br>
					Foot examination should include examination of plantar pads that are 0.5 cm thick in the forefoot and 1 cm thick in the heels.<sup>14</sup>
					<br>
					<br>
					The plantar pad provides protection to the metatarsal heads against internal trauma.<sup>14</sup>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>d. Vascular assessment</b>
					<br>
					During the anamnesis, the patient should be assessed by the presence of intermittent claudication or pain in lower limbs at rest.<sup>16</sup> If the patient has claudication, the distance at which pain occurs and anatomical site should be established (Table 4).<sup>16</sup>
					<br>
					<br>
					In the clinical evaluation, determine the presence of: skin atrophy, shiny skin, absence of hair (especially fingers), abnormal nail growth, pallor triggered by raising the limb, erythrocyanosis in vertical position.<sup>16</sup>
					<br>
					<br>
					Palpation of the pulses is important in the vascular examination of the foot; assess femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and pedal pulses.<sup>16</sup> Auscultation of arterial routes in search of murmurs is recommended.<sup>16</sup>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Capillary refill time:</b> up to 2 seconds is considered normal; between 2 and 4 seconds doubtful, and pathological if more than 4 seconds.<sup>16</sup></li>
						<li><b>Measurement of venous filling:</b> mark the vein; empty the vein with patient being upright; the patient sits and the time the vein takes to fill is measured.<sup>16</sup>
						The test is considered normal if filling time is less than 10 seconds; between 10 and 20 seconds, doubtful; and pathological if more than 20 seconds.<sup>16</sup></li>
						<li><b>Measurement of ankle-brachial index:</b> is performed by using bidirectional doppler; systolic pressure is determined in both arms and both ankles.<sup>17</sup> The highest values obtained at the level of the dorsalis
						pedis or posterior tibial are used to calculate the index (ankle systolic pressure (mmHg) / arm systolic pressure (mmHg) = ankle-brachial index).<sup>17</sup>
						</li>
						<li><b>Other tests:</b> in patients with special conditions, the skin temperature can be measured by infrared thermography (&#60;26°C may indicate ischemia; > 32-33°C may indicate infection or Charcot foot); measurement of transcutaneous oxygen tension, useful as a predictor of healing of an injury or
						amputation level (≥ 60 mmHg may indicate good flow; ≤30 mmHg supports severe ischemia); and pulse waves measurement and plethysmography, used in the evaluation of patients with severe ischemia.<sup>16</sup></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<b>e. Orthopedic assessment</b>
						<br>
						Anatomy, function, gait, supporting abnormalities and plantar pressure are critical in foot physical examination of diabetic patients.<sup>18</sup>
						<br>
						<br>
						The following is recommended:</p>
						<ul>
						<li><b>Inspection:</b> soles and dorsum of the foot (establish the presence of deformities such as hallux valgus, hallux varus, hallux flexus, hammer toes, claw toes, fingers overlapping, areas of hyperkeratosis, and evaluate plantar pads, etc.).<sup>18</sup>
						</li>
						<li> <b>Evaluation of the feet when standing:</b> to observe the alignment and foot arches (flat feet, cavus, varus or valgus).<sup>18</sup> Examination by podoscope or pedigraphy allows the static study of the footprint (normal fingerprint consists of the forefoot, the isthmus or middle region and hindfoot).<sup>18</sup> In the normal foot, the isthmus is a third of the forefoot; if less, there is an arched feet; and if it is greater, there is a flat foot.<sup>18</sup>
						</li>
						<li><b>X-rays of the foot (front, ¾ oblique, and lateral projections standing on one foot):</b>evaluate alignment, bone structures, joints and soft tissues of the foot.<sup>14,18</sup>
						</li>
						<li> <b>Other studies in patients with special conditions:</b> the dynamic gait analysis is useful in assessing how the foot behaves in the different phases of gait and if there is displacement or disruption of support.<sup>18</sup>
						</li>
						<li><b> Evaluation of footwear:</b> footwear observation is a simple technique for assessing the support points and foot deformities in patients with diabetes.<sup>25</sup></li>
						</ul>
					</p>	
					<p>
						It is recommended to evaluate the footwear for everyday use, and not new shoes.<sup>25</sup>
